# [My portfolio: Alyssa Geria](https://alyssageria.github.io/my-portfolio-page/)

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. Along this process I learned a lot about HTML and CSS, more specifically I learned how to format the basics of a website using HTML and I learned a lot about CSS grid, flexbox and media queries. There was a lot of trial and error that lead to the development of this portfolio webpage, and I can say that I am pretty happy with it considering it is my first webpage from scratch!

## Usage

This webpage consists of information about me, as well as ways to contact me. This is a responsive webpage that consists of some of my projects I have worked on as well as a bit of information about me.
